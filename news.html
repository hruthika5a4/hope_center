                <p class="pad_bot1"> Autism is a developmental disorder with symptoms that appear within the first three years of life. Its formal diagnostic name is autism spectrum disorder. The word “spectrum” indicates that autism appears in different forms with varying levels of severity </p>
                <p class="pad_bot2">That means that each individual with autism experiences their own unique strengths, symptoms, and challenges. </p>

              <h4><span>Reduced </span>Eye Contact</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">Over 7 out 10 individuals with autism experience vision problems. Visual symptoms of autism can include: Difficulty maintaining eye contact Fleeting peripheral glances Side viewing Staring at spinning objects or light Reduce visual attention span.</p>
              <h4 class="color2"><span> Differences</span>in body language</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">Individuals with autism have difficulty reading facial expressions and interpreting "body language"1234. However, new research indicates that children on the autism spectrum can identify emotions in body language just as accurately as their typically-developing peers5. 
                </p>
              <h4 class="color3"><span>Lack</span>of Facial Expressions</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong></strong></p>
              A blank facial expression may not mean the person is miserable, upset, lacking in cognitive skills, or anything else at all.
                Using non-autistic body language effectively may use large amounts of energy and requires coordination and motor skills.
                A lack of use of gestures or body language should not be interpreted as the person being disinterested or shut off.. </section>

              <h4><span>Diagnosis</span>& Screening</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">There is no known biological marker for autism. That means that no blood or genetic test can diagnose the disorder. Instead, clinicians rely on observation, medical histories, and questionnaires to determine whether an individual has autism. Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be difficult because there is no medical test, like a blood test, to diagnose the disorder. Doctors look at the child’s developmental history and behavior to make a diagnosis.</p>
              <h4 class="color2"><span>Developmental</span> Monitoring</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Physicians and specialists generally uses to monitoring </strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">Developmental monitoring is an active, ongoing process of watching a child grow and encouraging conversations between parents and providers about a child’s skills and abilities. Developmental monitoring involves observing how your child grows and whether your child meets the typical developmental milestones, or skills that most children reach by a certain age, in playing, learning, speaking, behaving, and moving.</p>
              <h4 class="color3"><span>Developmental </span> Screening</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Developmental screening takes a closer look at how your child is developing.

                 </strong></p>
                 Developmental screening is more formal than developmental monitoring. It is a regular part of some well-child visits even if there is not a known concern.
                
                 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screening for all children during regular well-child visits at these ages:
                 
                 9 months,
                 18 months,
                 30 months. </section>

              <h4><span>Treatment</span>Types</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Types of Treatment's that most of the Physicians and specialists uses </strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">Behavioral,
                Developmental,
                Educational,

                Pharmacological,

                Complementary and Alternative.</p>
              <h4 class="color2"><span>Psychological </span>Approaches</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>Psychological approaches can help people with ASD cope with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues</strong></p>
              <p class="pad_bot1">Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) is one psychological approach that focuses on learning the connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. During CBT, a therapist and the individual work together to identify goals and then change how the person thinks about a situation to change how they react to the situation.              </p>
              <h4 class="color3"><span>Pharmacological </span>Approaches</h4>
              <p class="pad_bot2"><strong>There are no medications that treat the core symptoms of ASD</strong></p>
              Some medications treat co-occurring symptoms that can help people with ASD function better. For example, medication might help manage high energy levels, inability to focus, or self-harming behavior, such as head banging or hand biting. Medication can also help manage co-occurring psychological conditions, such as anxiety or depression, in addition to medical conditions such as seizures, sleep problems, or stomach or other gastrointestinal problems. </section>
